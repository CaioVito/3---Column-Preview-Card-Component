## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this challenge I learned better to deal with Grid and Flexbox together, which is a skill that I consider to be important. A lot of the time I was writing code was just placing the elements on the screen, so I think it was a great exercise with these CSS properties.

### Continued development

Use the Grid property more often in other projects. It is a very powerful and complete tool for element placement.

### Useful resources

- [Origmid CSS Grid Course](https://youtu.be/hKXOVD2Yrj8) - Andr√© has good didactics to teach and his classes helped me a lot to better understand the property.
